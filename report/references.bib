  abstract = "Odometry is the most widely used method for determining the
              momentary position of a mobile robot. This paper introduces
              practical methods for measuring and reducing odometry errors that
              are caused by the two dominant error sources in
              differential-drive mobile robots: 1) uncertainty about the
              effective wheelbase; and 2) unequal wheel diameters. These errors
              stay almost constant over prolonged periods of time. Performing
              an occasional calibration as proposed here will increase the
              odometric accuracy of the robot and reduce operation cost because
              an accurate mobile robot requires fewer absolute positioning
              updates. Many manufacturers or end-users calibrate their robots,
              usually in a time-consuming and nonsystematic trial and error
              approach. By contrast, the method described in this paper is
              systematic, provides near-optimal results, and it can be
              performed easily and without complicated equipment. Experimental
              results are presented that show a consistent improvement of at
              least one order of magnitude in odometric accuracy (with respect
              to systematic errors) for a mobile robot calibrated with our
              method",

  abstract   = "Gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses are increasingly
                prevalent in mainstream consumer electronics. Applications of
                these sensors include user interface, augmented reality,
                gaming, image stabilization, and navigation. This talk will
                demonstrate how all three sensor types work separately and in
                conjunction on a modified Android handset running a modified
                sensor API, then explain how algorithms are used to enable a
                multitude of applications. Application developers who wish to
                make sense of rotational motion must master Euler angles,
                rotation matrices, and quaternions. Under the hood, sensor
                fusion algorithms must be used in order to create responsive,
                accurate, and low noise descriptions of motion. Reducing
                sensing errors involves compensating for temperature changes,
                magnetic disturbances, and sharp accelerations. Some of these
                algorithms must run at a very high rate and with very precise
                timing, which makes them difficult to implement within
                low-power real-time operating systems. Within Android
                specifically, this involves modifying the sensor manager,
                introducing new APIs, and partitioning motion processing tasks.
                David Sachs began developing motion processing systems as a
                graduate student at the MIT Media Lab. His research there led
                him to InvenSense, where he continues this work with MEMS
                inertial sensors used in products such as the Nintendo Wii
                Motion Plus. David's designs incorporate gyroscopes,
                accelerometers, and compasses in various combinations and
                contexts including handset user interfaces, image stabilizers,
                navigation systems, game controllers, novel Braille displays,
                and musical instruments.",

              properties by which location systems are evaluated, and apply
              this evaluation method to survey a number of existing systems.
