               versions presented at the International Conference on Genetic
               Algorithms in June 1991, as well as at a special Workshop on
               Genetic Algorithms for Machine Learning at the same Conference.
               Genetic algorithms are general-purpose search algorithms that
               use principles inspired by natural population genetics to evolve
               solutions to problems. The basic idea is to maintain a
               population of knowledge structure that represent candidate
               solutions to the problem of interest. The population evolves
               over time through a process of competition (i.e. survival of the
               fittest) and controlled variation (i.e. recombination and
               mutation). Genetic Algorithms for Machine Learning contains
               articles on three topics that have not been the focus of many
               previous articles on GAs, namely concept learning from examples,
               reinforcement learning for control, and theoretical analysis of
               GAs. It is hoped that this sample will serve to broaden the
               acquaintance of the general machine learning community with the
               major areas of work on GAs. The articles in this book address a
               number of central issues in applying GAs to machine learning
               problems. For example, the choice of appropriate representation
               and the corresponding set of genetic learning operators is an
               important set of decisions facing a user of a genetic algorithm.
               The study of genetic algorithms is proceeding at a robust pace.
               If experimental progress and theoretical understanding continue
               to evolve as expected, genetic algorithms will continue to
               provide a distinctive approach to machine learning. Genetic

               Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is one of the
               widely-used methods for solving the registration problem. Based
               on local iteration, ICP is however well-known to suffer from
               local minima. Its performance critically relies on the quality
               of initialization, and only local optimality is guaranteed. This
               paper provides the very first globally optimal solution to
               Euclidean registration of two 3D point sets or two 3D surfaces
               under the L2 error. Our method is built upon ICP, but combines

              pose (position and orientation) of a mobile robot by registering
              a segment-based local map observed from the current robot pose
              and a global map. The method works in a two-stage procedure.
              First, the orientation is determined by aligning the local and
              global map through a voting process based on a generalized Hough
              transform. Second, it uses a coarse-to-fine approach for
              selecting candidate positions and a weighted voting scheme to
              determine the degree of overlap of the two maps at each of these
              poses. Unlike other methods previously proposed, this approach
              allows us to uncouple the problem of estimating the robot
              orientation and the robot position which may be useful for some
              applications. In addition it can manage environments described by

              issues of perception, categorization and motor control that must
              all be solved in an integrated manner to promote survival. This
              point is illustrated here, within the framework of a review of
              localization strategies in mobile robots. The allothetic and
              idiothetic sensors that may be used by these robots to build
              internal representations of their environment, and the maps in
              which these representations may be instantiated, are first
              described. Then map-based navigation systems are categorized
              according to a three-level hierarchy of localization strategies,
              which respectively call upon direct position inference,
              single-hypothesis tracking, and multiple-hypothesis tracking. The
              advantages and drawbacks of these strategies, notably with
              respect to the limitations of the sensors on which they rely, are
              discussed throughout the text.",

               give some simple didactic examples. We then present the tool
               that we think is extremely well-adapted to solving most of these

               representations can be combined to provide solutions for some of

              momentary position of a mobile robot. This paper introduces
              practical methods for measuring and reducing odometry errors that
              are caused by the two dominant error sources in
              differential-drive mobile robots: 1) uncertainty about the
              effective wheelbase; and 2) unequal wheel diameters. These errors
              stay almost constant over prolonged periods of time. Performing
              an occasional calibration as proposed here will increase the

                multitude of applications. Application developers who wish to
                make sense of rotational motion must master Euler angles,
                rotation matrices, and quaternions. Under the hood, sensor
                fusion algorithms must be used in order to create responsive,
                accurate, and low noise descriptions of motion. Reducing
                sensing errors involves compensating for temperature changes,

                gaming, image stabilization, and navigation. This talk will
                demonstrate how all three sensor types work separately and in
                conjunction on a modified Android handset running a modified
                sensor API, then explain how algorithms are used to enable a
                multitude of applications. Application developers who wish to
                make sense of rotational motion must master Euler angles,
                rotation matrices, and quaternions. Under the hood, sensor
                fusion algorithms must be used in order to create responsive,
                accurate, and low noise descriptions of motion. Reducing
                sensing errors involves compensating for temperature changes,
                magnetic disturbances, and sharp accelerations. Some of these
                algorithms must run at a very high rate and with very precise
                timing, which makes them difficult to implement within
                low-power real-time operating systems. Within Android
                specifically, this involves modifying the sensor manager,
                introducing new APIs, and partitioning motion processing tasks.
                David Sachs began developing motion processing systems as a

              practical methods for measuring and reducing odometry errors that
              are caused by the two dominant error sources in
              differential-drive mobile robots: 1) uncertainty about the
              effective wheelbase; and 2) unequal wheel diameters. These errors
              stay almost constant over prolonged periods of time. Performing
              an occasional calibration as proposed here will increase the

               of an algorithm faster than the iterative closest point (ICP).

               real laser scans from known relative positions to establish a
               ground truth. Furthermore, to demonstrate the practical

              the registration of point clouds for the purpose of terrain
              mapping, using data obtained from a mobile platform. The
              methodology of the study has involved taking sequences of 100
              consecutive scans at three distinct scenes along the route of a
              mining haul truck operating in a typical surface mining
              environment. The scan sequences were obtained at 20 Hz from a
              Velodyne HDL-64E mounted on the truck. The aim is to understand
              how well the ICP variants perform in consolidating these scans
              into sub-maps. Variants are compared against three metrics:
              accuracy, precision, and relative computational cost. The main
              finding of the paper is that none of the variants is
              simultaneously accurate, precise, and fast to compute, across all
              three scenes. The best performing variants employed strategies
              that filtered the data sets, used local surface geometry in the

              cloud to a corresponding surface from a reference point cloud as
              a measure of the fit between two point clouds. The significance

               accurate, robust and fast solution is, therefore, of great
               significance. Recently genetic algorithms have attracted great
               interest for their ability to robustly solve hard optimization
               problems. In this work we investigate the performance of such an
               approach for finding the initial guess of the transformation, a
               translation and a rotation, between the object and the model
               surface. This is followed by a local gradient descent method,
               such as iterative closest point, to refine the estimate.
               Promising results are demonstrated on accurate real data",

              and Automation) and P. J. Besl and N. D. McKay (1992, IEEE Trans.
              Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 14, 239---256). That algorithm,
              though, is only one approach to optimizing a least-squares point

              Blostein (1987, IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell.9,

              its reliance on preregistration by hand close to the global
              minimum and its tendency to converge to suboptimal or incorrect
              solutions. This paper reports on an evolutionary registration
              algorithm which does not require initial prealignment and has a
              very broad basin ofconvergence. It searches many areas of a
              registration parameter space in parallel and has available to it
              a selection of evolutionary techniques to avoid local minima
              which plague both ICP and its variants.",

               this problem is solved by dead reckoning, based on measurement
               of wheel rotations or step counts and step width. Unfortunately
               dead reckoning leads to accumulation of drift errors and is very
               sensitive to slipping. In this paper an algorithm for tracking
               position and orientation is presented, it is nearly independent
               from odometry and its problems with slipping. To achieve these
               results, a rotating range-finder is used, delivering scans of
               the environmental structure. The properties of this structure
               are used to match the scans from different locations in order to
               find their translational and rotational displacement. For this
               purpose derivatives of range-finder scans are calculated which
               can be used to find position and orientation by crosscorrelation",
