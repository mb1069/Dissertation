               application of two methods that are very different in essence:
               (i) A 2D version of iterative closest point (ICP), which is
               widely used for surface registration; (ii) a genetic algorithm
               (GA), which is a novel approach for this kind of problem. Their

               a piecewise continuous and differentiable probability density,
               that can be used to match another scan using Newton's algorithm.

              paper explores the performance of 20,736 ICP variants applied to
              the registration of point clouds for the purpose of terrain
              mapping, using data obtained from a mobile platform. The
              methodology of the study has involved taking sequences of 100
              consecutive scans at three distinct scenes along the route of a
              mining haul truck operating in a typical surface mining
              environment. The scan sequences were obtained at 20 Hz from a
              Velodyne HDL-64E mounted on the truck. The aim is to understand
              how well the ICP variants perform in consolidating these scans
              into sub-maps. Variants are compared against three metrics:
              accuracy, precision, and relative computational cost. The main
              finding of the paper is that none of the variants is
              simultaneously accurate, precise, and fast to compute, across all
              three scenes. The best performing variants employed strategies
              that filtered the data sets, used local surface geometry in the
              form normals, and used the distance between points in one point
              cloud to a corresponding surface from a reference point cloud as
              a measure of the fit between two point clouds. The significance
              of this work is that it: (i) provides guidance in the
              construction of ICP variants for terrain mapping; and (ii)
              identifies the significant limitations of existing ICP variants

               have to be registered (i.e. the relative transformation between
               the partial models has to be determined) prior to the merging
               process. In this paper a method is presented that makes use of
               both camera-based depth information (e.g. from stereo) and the

               determine corresponding point sets on the partial surfaces using
               an optical flow approach. Quaternions are then employed to
               determine the transformation between the partial models which
               minimizes the sum of the 3-D Euclidian distances between the
               corresponding point sets. In order to find corresponding points
               on the partial surfaces luminance information is linearized. The

               to only using depth information, employing luminance speeds up

               registration and integration of multiple range images for

               algorithm determines a set of rigid motion parameters that
               register a range image to a given mesh-based geometric model.
               The algorithm is an integration of the iterative closest point
               algorithm with the least median of squares estimator. After
               registration, points in the input range are classified into
               inliers and outliers according to registration errors between
